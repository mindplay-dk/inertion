To run these examples, first create a local copy of the package - from the root
folder of the project, run the `npm pack` command to create a packed copy:

    npm run pack --pack-destination examples

A packed `.tgz` file will land in the examples folder - this will be installed
when you run `npm install` in e.g. the `examples/basic` folder.
